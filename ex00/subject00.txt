1. Arrays and DataFrames in Python

We want to simulate a process of analyzing patient temperatures.
To do this, we will create a 2D matrix (rows - days / columns - patients) with random temperature values.
We will calculate the average, the minimum, and the maximum value for each patient and each day.
Try swapping row orders, sorting the array, and formatting the output to limit the number of decimals.

In Python:
Version 1: Without using DataFrames.
Version 2: Using DataFrames.
