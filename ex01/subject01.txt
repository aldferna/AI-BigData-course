We want to create a height estimation based on age with real data (children_height_age.csv) 
using linear regression.

Three models will be done: female/male and both.
Six predictions will be held for each model: 
- 7 and a half years old
- 8 and a half years old
- 9 and a half years old
- 14 and a half years old 
- 15 and a half years old
- 16 and a half years old

Create a .ipynb file and the predictions chart.
